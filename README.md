# gitops-alternative-layouts

This repository illustrates some alternative repository layouts supported by the tool being developed in https://github.com/rhd-gitops-example/services. 

See the companion repositories https://github.com/rhd-gitops-example/gitops-example-staging and https://github.com/rhd-gitops-example/gitops-example-dev which represents repositories which each contain separate environments (whereas the layout here allows for multiple environments in the same repository, across several branches).

The main goal of this repository is to have layouts to observe and test with, it is NOT intended to provide any real examples or best practices.
